# aspnetcore-mvc-fragments

## What is it for?
It aims to reduce ttfb (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_first_byte) of aspnet mvc core applications. Also it forces developers to create reusable and lightweight components.

## How does it work?
The idea behind is render placeholders first, then asynchronously render actual contents and replace with place holders. Detailes will be here soon.

## How to use it?
Will be here soon.
